# PolyGaj

# What is PolyGaj?

Polygaj is the first product in an ecosystem of DeFi & NFT products which are being built around two tokens GAJ & GMAM. 

The GAJ token is designed to be the centerpiece of a family of DeFi products with Polygaj being the first dapp. The other products are due to be launched over the coming weeks. The GMAM token is going to be the centerpiece of a family of NFT + DeFi products. This will include NFT Staking, farming etc. 
I want to build a long and sustainable vision for the GAJ & GMAM token which will include innovative products at the intersection of DeFi & NFT’s. Polygaj is just the beginning!
The current emission rate of GAJ is 21,600 tokens every day. The Polygaj project will remain live and continue to mint tokens for a period of 180 days. This means that in total 3,888,000 tokens of GAJ will be minted in total. 100K tokens have been created before to kickstart this project and ecosystem. 
Any kind of infinite minting is not sustainable. This has already been proven with many such projects being developed on Polygon, which are turning into pump and dump events. As described in the roadmap, the focus right now is to build more DeFi products. I will also be introducing the NFT products in the next quarter. 

# Roadmap

## Q2 2021: Product Roadmap

### Mammoth Farms - GMAM Farming

The objective of this farm is to help users stake GAJ LP’s along with GAJ in order to farm GMAM tokens. The following farms are planned:
GAJ-USDC LP + GAJ
GAJ-USDT LP + GAJ
GAJ-DAI LP + GAJ
GAJ-ETH LP + GAJ
GAJ-WBTC + GAJ

The deposit fees for the staking pools will be paid in GAJ tokens. These farms will generate the GMAM tokens which will be the token around which we will build the NFT products. 

### Jungle Pools - MATIC  Farming

Next, we are creating Jungle Pools ( inspired by Pancake Swap )
The following farms are planned:

GAJ-USDC LP + GMAM 
GAJ-USDT LP + GMAM
GAJ-DAI LP + GMAM
GAJ-ETH LP + GMAM
GAJ-WBTC + GMAM

The deposit fees of the farms will be paid in  $GMAM (Mammoth Farming Token) to earn MATIC

## Q3 Product Roadmap

### NFT Airdrops
We will be releasing exclusive GAJ NFTs with special sales and if you’re in early you may be in luck since we will be doing a NFT airdrop to hype our new releases!

### NFT Staking
Inspired from Unifty & Charged Particles - I want to create pools with NFT’s which will have special abilities. The GMAM token will be at the center of this ecosystem and I plan to meld different concepts of NFT’s and DeFi and create interesting products for people to try out. 

### Governance
I’m still playing with this idea of how to include governance. I feel that a 100% decentralized project will yield the best results and the community can decide on the direction of development. I will then be a tool in the hands of the community, who I hope will guide me well on what needs to be built over the coming months and years. Stay tuned for more details on this.
